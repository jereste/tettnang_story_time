When I woke up I immediately bought tickets to the Rammstein concert in Rammstein!
Mehlhase headed to the biergarten.
On the way I grabbed some Brot. 
I decided to eat some bratwurst with my Brot.
I was still hungry so I purchased some apfelkuchen but accidentally dropped it...
After I hopped in my Porsche because I don't like BMWs.
To grab some Gebaeck from the Baeckerei.
I shared my Gabaeck with my hund named George.
Got my lederhose on, ready for anything.
Now have to get ready to head to the Berlin flughafen.
